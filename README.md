## Custom Data Structures in Java

This project contains custom implementations of basic data structures in Java without using built-in utility classes such as ArrayList, LinkedList, or Stack. All classes are built from scratch, providing a clear understanding of how data structures work under the hood.


MyList<T> – Interface defining common list operations

MyArrayList<T> – Dynamic array implementation

MyLinkedList<T> – Doubly linked list implementation

MyStack<T> – Stack built on top of a list (LIFO)

MyQueue<T> – Queue built on top of a list (FIFO)

MyMinHeap<T extends Comparable<T> – Binary Min Heap using an array-based list


# Each function will:

Add and remove elements

Check behavior like sorting, peeking, popping

Print internal state and size
